00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,362
BREAKING:

2
00:00:00,362 --> 00:00:02,538
Ravens in a Real Mess, Folks!

3
00:00:02,538 --> 00:00:04,714
Lamar Jackson's out with a hamstring

4
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:06,890
injury, and it's like the whole

5
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,066
team is saying, 'Sky is falling,

6
00:00:09,066 --> 00:00:10,154
sky is falling!

7
00:00:10,154 --> 00:00:12,329
' (chuckles) Cooper Rush, the new

8
00:00:12,329 --> 00:00:14,505
starter, is like the calm in

9
00:00:14,505 --> 00:00:16,681
the storm, saying, 'Hey, I've been

10
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:18,494
here before, it's all good!

11
00:00:18,494 --> 00:00:20,670
' (sarcastically) Yeah, sure, buddy, you've

12
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,758
been here before.

13
00:00:21,758 --> 00:00:23,934
in a different team, with a

14
00:00:23,934 --> 00:00:26,110
different playbook, and with a better

15
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:26,473
haircut!

16
00:00:26,473 --> 00:00:28,648
(laughs) Anyway, the Ravens are 1-3,

17
00:00:28,648 --> 00:00:30,099
and it's getting ugly.

18
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:32,275
They've got nine players on the

19
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:34,451
injury list, including three Pro Bowlers.

20
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,627
The Texans are looking to beat

21
00:00:36,627 --> 00:00:38,802
them for the first time since

22
00:00:38,802 --> 00:00:39,165
2014.

23
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:41,341
Can the Ravens turn it around?

24
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,517
(shrugs) I'm not holding my breath.

25
00:00:43,517 --> 00:00:43,880
Stay tuned, folks!
